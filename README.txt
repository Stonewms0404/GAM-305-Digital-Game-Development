Choose a scenario and select the four additional elements you will include.
	Player Power-up Pickups (health, power ups, etc.) (at least 3 unique types, can be placed around the level)
		Health Pack (extra life similar to Mario, take damage and retain small invincibility [WIP])
		Invincibility
		Machine Gun Power Up
	Player Equipment Pickups (armor, weapons, ammo, etc.) (minimum 3 armor, 3 weapons; placed around the level)
		Pistol Fire (pick up style similar to CSGO for weapon choices)
		Spread Fire
		Homing Fire
		Rapid Fire
	Enemies (Moving) (2 types, can be moving on platforms or jumping around)
		Melee Enemy (moving towards the player)
		Ranged Enemy (move towards the player and stops at specific distance, start shooting player[cooldown to have the enemy begin moving again])
	Enemies (Stationary) (2 types, will not move)
		Turret (shielded, need to walk close to destroy)
		Tower Spawner


Brainstorm on content based on the preferred scenario in the design document.
	Player will navigate different rooms to reach the exit while dodging enemies and navigating obstacles. The player will need to clear rooms one at a time in search of the exit but 	the exit will have require a key to unlock. Player will be able to utilize powerups and equipment to dispatch the enemies of each room to make it to the exit.

Determine the development goals for the Alpha and Beta Stage submissions (which assets/elements should be in place and what level of functionality you are going to use to track the project progress in the Alpha and Beta stages).
	Alpha Stage Goals
		Maps
		Player movement, pickups, interactable, camera movements
		Enemy spawners
		Projectiles
		Enemy Placements
		Key + Door Functionality
		Playable, however does not look pretty

	Beta Stage Goals
		Player and Enemy Gon models
		Modeling
		Textures added
		Sounds

Choose preferred communication method(s).
	Discord Voice Communication
	Miro Board for Project Planning Communication

Choose the frequency of communication (team meeting).
	Once a week Voice Communication Meeting on Sat/Sun

Choose a method for assigning and reporting on specific task items.

Module 3: QA Test Plan
	How will you test objects, levels, and games during the development cycle? Develop a schedule and include:
		Play Test: Testing during the preproduction stage
			Manual testing from the developers themselves for a rough outline of how well the game runs, how balanced it is, and how much fun it is to play.
			This will be done throughout the entire development process until the Alpha Release.
	Demo: Testing before marketing will demo the project
		This testing will commence from the developers giving copies to other students, testers, family members, or friends for a closer look at the fine details and how the game can break.
		Keeping a detailed reaction to every playtester by either recording it, standing nearby, or having the testers write down their experience will be a good way to track the testing aspect of the game.
		These tests will be applied throughout the Beta stage of development with more testing and rough benchmarks of each stage of the game to see what elements are less favorable.
		The final stretch of the project, before submission, will be one last round of testing with the same testers and new testers to gauge progress and other elements of the project.
	Code Release: Checking the code release demo with the test plan
		To test the code, comments will be thrown into the code for easy readability and more benchmarking to make sure that basic elements do not tank FPS.
		Some ways to benchmark is to make sure that spawning objects and projectiles is optimized by either batching, spawn pooling, or other measures to keep certain elements loaded at all times to keep a consistent framerate.
	What items will be tested? Include a checklist of items to be tested (pass/fail).
		Framerate/frame drops
			Are there any points where the game drops frames
			Is the game running lower than 120FPS at any point when running it?
		Player weapons
			Balanced and not too under/over powered
			Destructive and visually appealing
			Are the weapons fun to use?
		Enemy weapons
			Not too destructive
			Challenging gameplay
		Enemy spawn rates
			Making sure that the player does not get overrun by the amount of enemies on screen
		Fun
			Are the players having fun playing the game?
		UI
			Making sure the game pauses when the pause button is pressed
			Ensuring the buttons work properly on every UI element
	How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?
		Using Miro and possibly Trello to mark which bugs are tracked
		Marking every detail down in a visual format to make sure the project is easy to organize
	How will bugs be reported?
		Taking any resource of written, verbal, or visual feedback from testers and compile them.
		Either adding an area on Miro or creating a Trello board to add entries of bugs
	How will the bugs and their changes be tracked over time?
		On Miro: changing the color of the box that it is contained in to mark the stage it is in (not completed, in-progress, and completed).
		On Trello: moving each box to a different column for tracking what stage it is in (not completed, in-progress, and completed).
