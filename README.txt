Choose a scenario and select the four additional elements you will include.
	Player Power-up Pickups (health, power ups, etc.) (at least 3 unique types, can be placed around the level)
		Health Pack (extra life similar to Mario, take damage and retain small invincibility [WIP])
		Invincibility
		Machine Gun Power Up
	Player Equipment Pickups (armor, weapons, ammo, etc.) (minimum 3 armor, 3 weapons; placed around the level)
		Pistol Fire (pick up style similar to CSGO for weapon choices)
		Spread Fire
		Homing Fire
		Rapid Fire
	Enemies (Moving) (2 types, can be moving on platforms or jumping around)
		Melee Enemy (moving towards the player)
		Ranged Enemy (move towards the player and stops at specific distance, start shooting player[cooldown to have the enemy begin moving again])
	Enemies (Stationary) (2 types, will not move)
		Turret (shielded, need to walk close to destroy)
		Tower Spawner


Brainstorm on content based on the preferred scenario in the design document.
	Player will navigate different rooms to reach the exit while dodging enemies and navigating obstacles. The player will need to clear rooms one at a time in search of the exit but 	the exit will have require a key to unlock. Player will be able to utilize powerups and equipment to dispatch the enemies of each room to make it to the exit.

Module 3: QA Test Plan
	How will you test objects, levels, and games during the development cycle? Develop a schedule and include:
		Play Test: Testing during the preproduction stage
			Manual testing from the developers themselves for a rough outline of how well the game runs, how balanced it is, and how much fun it is to play.
			This will be done throughout the entire development process until the Alpha Release.
	Demo: Testing before marketing will demo the project
		This testing will commence from the developers giving copies to other students, testers, family members, or friends for a closer look at the fine details and how the game can break.
		Keeping a detailed reaction to every playtester by either recording it, standing nearby, or having the testers write down their experience will be a good way to track the testing aspect of the game.
		These tests will be applied throughout the Beta stage of development with more testing and rough benchmarks of each stage of the game to see what elements are less favorable.
		The final stretch of the project, before submission, will be one last round of testing with the same testers and new testers to gauge progress and other elements of the project.
	Code Release: Checking the code release demo with the test plan
		To test the code, comments will be thrown into the code for easy readability and more benchmarking to make sure that basic elements do not tank FPS.
		Some ways to benchmark is to make sure that spawning objects and projectiles is optimized by either batching, spawn pooling, or other measures to keep certain elements loaded at all times to keep a consistent framerate.
	What items will be tested? Include a checklist of items to be tested (pass/fail).
		Framerate/frame drops
			Are there any points where the game drops frames
			Is the game running lower than 120FPS at any point when running it?
		Player weapons
			Balanced and not too under/over powered
			Destructive and visually appealing
			Are the weapons fun to use?
		Enemy weapons
			Not too destructive
			Challenging gameplay
		Enemy spawn rates
			Making sure that the player does not get overrun by the amount of enemies on screen
		Fun
			Are the players having fun playing the game?
		UI
			Making sure the game pauses when the pause button is pressed
			Ensuring the buttons work properly on every UI element
	How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?
		Using Miro and possibly Trello to mark which bugs are tracked
		Marking every detail down in a visual format to make sure the project is easy to organize
	How will bugs be reported?
		Taking any resource of written, verbal, or visual feedback from testers and compile them.
		Either adding an area on Miro or creating a Trello board to add entries of bugs
	How will the bugs and their changes be tracked over time?
		On Miro: changing the color of the box that it is contained in to mark the stage it is in (not completed, in-progress, and completed).
		On Trello: moving each box to a different column for tracking what stage it is in (not completed, in-progress, and completed).

Module 4: Alpha Release
	What parts of the testing process did the team perceive to go well?
		Character movement and enemy movement and attacks work as intended.
		Enemy behavior, including shooting, spawning, and melee attacks, all work great.
	How were bugs identified and corrected?
		In testing, we identified that the Player script was not working correctly
		when we added it to a new scene, as it could move around, but wasn't able to shoot.
		We figured out that it was missing the other components in the scene it was relying
		on to spawn projectiles, so we were able to quickly fix the issue by adding those
		components.
	In terms of the QA and testing process, what would you do differently to improve the process?
		By completing rough drafts of the important code to test early, we could have more
		time to test the code and find important game-breaking bugs earlier, giving us more
		time to focus on fixing them.
	What tools (chosen in Module Two) did you find successful in the development of your Alpha
	project? Why?
		Blender has been a great tool to use for creating the models, because it's very easy
		to import from Blender into Unity. Organizational tools like Miro and Discord have
		also been a lot of help to us for organizing and collaborating.
	Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your
	project development? Why?
		A tool that was not as helpful to us in our project development is Trello, as we
		have done most of our organizing, collaboration, and planning in both the Discord
		and Miro. Miro especially has been a huge help in brainstorming ideas together and
		writing down our timeline.
	How did the team approach to the initial analysis of the game design document contribute
	to the decision to use these tools and techniques?
		We wanted to use the tools we were all familiar with, and most comfortable using.
		This is why we chose to build the game in unity and make the models in Blender.

	Programming:
		Towers shooting & spawning proper enemies & bullets (Stone Williams)
		Player is able to shoot properly within the MainScene (Stone Williams)
		Player can pick up a key that opens the gate at the end (Jonathan LeMasters)

		Turret model finished (Jonathan LeMasters)
		Shield model finished (Jonathan LeMasters)
		Player, enemy, tower, and turret models added to the game (Jonathan LeMasters)
	Unity Manager/Level Designer:
		Created full level layout with walls (Jonathan LeMasters)
		Added enemy spawners and turrets to the level (Jonathan LeMasters)



Module 5: Beta Release
	What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go well in relation to the last stage 
	evaluation?
		We have a great beta of the game working right now. Most of the major things we 
		had planned are implemented and working great, and there are only very minimal 
		bugs.
	What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go wrong in relation to the last stage
	evaluation?
		We aren't as far along in the development process as we had originally hoped,
		so it is unlikely we'll be able to add any of the extra nice-to-have features
		we were brainstorming.
	How were the previous evaluations integrated into this latest stage?
		We encountered issues such as the player not being able to shoot or the towers
		being able to shoot into the ground and come back up to hit the player. This
		was resolved by using Unity's methods of checking the tags on the objects that
		were colliding to ensure the projectiles destroy on impact with the ground and
		other wall objects.
	What would you do differently to improve the collaboration or development process?
		A better system of communication and vocal meetings would be a better way of
		collaboration and making sure we all get progress done during the week.
	Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your
	project development? Why?
		We have been trying to add emission to the materials through the use of Blender's
		material editor, but ran into problems trying to import the materials into Unity.
		Future materials will probably need to be made using Unity, instead of trying to
		import them from Blender.
	Identify the completed stage of development of the intended Beta and address the project
	schedule to meet Final Release development deadline.
		The functionality of the game is completed and we are looking to completely test
		everything this upcoming week for the final release to find any bugs and add final
		details to balance the game as a whole.
