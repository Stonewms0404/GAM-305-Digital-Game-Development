Choose a scenario and select the four additional elements you will include.
	Player Power-up Pickups (health, power ups, etc.) (at least 3 unique types, can be placed around the level)
		Health Pack (extra life similar to Mario, take damage and retain small invincibility [WIP])
		Invincibility
		Machine Gun Power Up
	Player Equipment Pickups (armor, weapons, ammo, etc.) (minimum 3 armor, 3 weapons; placed around the level)
		Pistol Fire (pick up style similar to CSGO for weapon choices)
		Spread Fire
		Homing Fire
		Rapid Fire
	Enemies (Moving) (2 types, can be moving on platforms or jumping around)
		Melee Enemy (moving towards the player)
		Ranged Enemy (move towards the player and stops at specific distance, start shooting player[cooldown to have the enemy begin moving again])
	Enemies (Stationary) (2 types, will not move)
		Turret (shielded, need to walk close to destroy)
		Tower Spawner


Brainstorm on content based on the preferred scenario in the design document.
	Player will navigate different rooms to reach the exit while dodging enemies and navigating obstacles. The player will need to clear rooms one at a time in search of the exit but 	the exit will have require a key to unlock. Player will be able to utilize powerups and equipment to dispatch the enemies of each room to make it to the exit.
